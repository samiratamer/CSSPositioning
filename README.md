# CSS Layout & Positioning – Blog Page

A CSS layout project styling a provided HTML blog page using advanced positioning 
techniques to achieve a multi-section, responsive layout.

## Layout Requirements Met
- Jump menu is fixed to the left side and spans the full height of the page

- Journal articles are neatly organized in the main content area
- Articles reorganize responsively when the browser window is resized

## Files
- `index.html` — provided HTML file

## How to View
